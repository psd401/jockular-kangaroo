## Product Requirements Document: Intervention Tracking System (MVP)

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the product requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a web-based Intervention Tracking System for the Peninsula School District. This system aims to streamline the process of assigning, tracking, and monitoring student interventions. The initial focus is on providing core functionality for teachers and ESAs, with future iterations expanding to include features for administrators and district-level oversight.

**2. Goals**

*   Provide a centralized and user-friendly platform for teachers and ESAs to manage student interventions.
*   Enable efficient tracking of intervention assignments, progress, and goals.
*   Improve communication and collaboration among educators involved in student support.
*   Lay the foundation for future expansion of features and user roles.

**3. Target Users**

*   **Primary Users:** Teachers and Educational Support Assistants (ESAs) responsible for assigning and tracking student interventions.
*   **Secondary Users (View-Only in MVP):** School Administrators and Counselors (limited to viewing student progress).

**4. Scope (MVP)**

This MVP will include the following core features:

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   Secure user authentication with role-based access control.
    *   Initial roles: Teacher/ESA and Administrator/Counselor (view-only).
*   **Student Data Management:**
    *   Automated nightly synchronization of student demographic data from the existing SIS (via direct database calls or CSV import).
    *   Searchable student list.
    *   View student profile with assigned interventions and progress data.
*   **Intervention Assignment:**
    *   Ability to select a student for intervention.
    *   Dropdown menu for selecting pre-defined intervention types: "Phonics," "Fluency," "Comprehension."
    *   Option to create custom intervention types.
    *   Fields for:
        *   Start Date (with date picker).
        *   End Date (automatically calculated as 6 weeks from the start date, but editable).
        *   Frequency (number of times within the date range).
        *   Goal (text field).
        *   Baseline Score (numeric field).
    *   Button to "Assign Intervention."
*   **Progress Tracking:**
    *   Section to "Add Progress Data" for each assigned intervention.
    *   Dropdown to select the specific assignment.
    *   Date field (with date picker).
    *   Score field (numeric).
    *   Button to "Add Progress."
*   **Progress Visualization:**
    *   Basic line graph displaying progress data over time for each intervention, as currently implemented in the UI.
*   **Branding and UI:**
    *   Implementation of the Peninsula School District branding guidelines (logos, colors, typography) as provided.

**5. Out of Scope (MVP)**

The following features are considered out of scope for the initial MVP and will be considered for future iterations:

*   Mobile application.
*   Detailed reporting and analytics beyond the basic progress graph.
*   Automated notifications and alerts.
*   Advanced collaboration features (e.g., real-time co-editing of intervention plans).
*   District-level dashboard for monitoring progress across schools.
*   Integration with other external systems beyond the SIS.
*   Archiving of past intervention data (will be addressed in a post-MVP iteration).

**6. Functional Requirements**

*   **FR.1: User Authentication:** The system shall provide secure user authentication using username and password.
*   **FR.2: Role-Based Access Control:** The system shall implement role-based access control, initially differentiating between Teacher/ESA and Administrator/Counselor roles.
*   **FR.3: Student Data Synchronization:** The system shall automatically synchronize student demographic data nightly from the SIS.
*   **FR.4: Student Search:**  Teachers/ESAs shall be able to search for students by name or ID.
*   **FR.5: View Student Profile:** Teachers/ESAs shall be able to view a student's profile, including their assigned interventions and progress data. Administrators/Counselors shall have read-only access to this information.
*   **FR.6: Assign Intervention:** Teachers/ESAs shall be able to assign interventions to students, including selecting a pre-defined or custom intervention type, start and end dates, frequency, goal, and baseline score.
*   **FR.7: Add Progress Data:** Teachers/ESAs shall be able to add progress data for assigned interventions, including the date and a numeric score.
*   **FR.8: Visualize Progress:** The system shall display a line graph visualizing the progress data for each assigned intervention over time.
*   **FR.9: Apply Branding:** The system shall adhere to the Peninsula School District's branding guidelines for visual elements.

**7. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **NF.1: Performance:** The system shall be responsive and provide fast load times for data entry and viewing.
*   **NF.2: Scalability:** The system architecture should be able to support up to 600 concurrent teacher/ESA users and data for 9000 students.
*   **NF.3: Security:** The system shall be secure and compliant with FERPA regulations, ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of student data.
*   **NF.4: Reliability:** The system should be reliable and available during school hours.
*   **NF.5: Usability:** The system shall have a clear, intuitive, and user-friendly interface to facilitate ease of use for teachers and ESAs.

**8. Technical Requirements**

*   **Platform:** Web-based application accessible via modern web browsers.
*   **Hosting:** AWS Amplify.
*   **Backend Infrastructure:** Serverless architecture on AWS (e.g., AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB or Aurora Serverless).
*   **Database:**  A suitable NoSQL or relational database on AWS (DynamoDB or Aurora Serverless are recommended for simplicity and scalability).
*   **Authentication:** AWS Cognito for secure user authentication and management.
*   **SIS Integration:**  Mechanism for nightly data synchronization (direct database calls or CSV import â€“ the chosen method will need further technical specification).
*   **Frontend Framework:**  React (as the existing interface suggests) or another suitable modern JavaScript framework.

**9. Release Criteria (MVP)**

*   All functional requirements outlined in Section 6 are implemented and tested.
*   The system meets the non-functional requirements for performance, security, and usability.
*   Basic user acceptance testing (UAT) is completed with representative teachers/ESAs.
*   The application is deployed and accessible on AWS Amplify.

**10. Future Considerations**

*   Implementation of features listed as "Out of Scope" for the MVP.
*   Gathering user feedback after the MVP launch to inform future development.
*   Exploring integrations with other educational tools.

**Next Steps:**

*   **Technical Design:** Detailed design of the backend architecture, database schema, and API endpoints.
*   **UI/UX Design Refinement:** Applying the branding guidelines to all UI elements.
*   **Development:** Building and testing the application components.
